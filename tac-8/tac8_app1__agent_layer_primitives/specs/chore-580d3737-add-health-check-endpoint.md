# Chore: Add Health Check Endpoint

## Metadata
adw_id: `580d3737`
prompt: `add a health check end point to  apps/server.py`

## Chore Description
Add a dedicated health check endpoint to the FastAPI server in `apps/server.py`. While the server currently has basic endpoints at `/` and `/api/status`, this chore will add a more standard `/health` endpoint that follows common health check conventions for production systems.

## Relevant Files
Use these files to complete the chore:

- `apps/server.py` - Main FastAPI server file where the health check endpoint will be added
- `requirements.txt` - Contains FastAPI dependencies that are already sufficient for this task

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### 1. Add Standard Health Check Endpoint
- Add a new `/health` endpoint that returns a simple JSON response indicating server health
- Include basic system information like status and timestamp
- Follow REST API conventions for health check endpoints
- Ensure the endpoint is lightweight and fast to respond

### 2. Update API Documentation
- Add proper docstring documentation for the new health check endpoint
- Ensure the endpoint appears in the automatically generated FastAPI docs

### 3. Validate Implementation
- Test that the new `/health` endpoint returns the expected response
- Verify the endpoint is accessible and responds quickly
- Confirm the endpoint appears in the FastAPI documentation

## Validation Commands
Execute these commands to validate the chore is complete:

- `cd /Users/indydevdan/Documents/projects/agentic-engineer/tactical-agentic-coding/tac-8/tac8_app1__agent_layer_primitives`
- `python apps/server.py` - Start the server
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` - Test the health check endpoint
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` - Verify endpoint appears in FastAPI documentation

## Notes
The server already has health-related endpoints (`/` and `/api/status`), but adding a dedicated `/health` endpoint follows industry standards and provides a more specific health check interface that monitoring systems typically expect.
