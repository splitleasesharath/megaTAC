# Chore: Build Minimal FastAPI Server

## Metadata
adw_id: `8faf73eb`
prompt: `build a minimal fastapi server in apps/server.py`

## Chore Description
Create a minimal FastAPI server implementation in the `apps/server.py` file. This server should provide basic REST API functionality with a simple endpoint structure that can serve as a foundation for the application layer of the agentic coding framework.

## Relevant Files
Use these files to complete the chore:

- `apps/main.py` - Existing Python application entry point, shows current Python setup
- `README.md` - Project documentation explaining the Agent Layer Primitives structure

### New Files
- `apps/server.py` - New FastAPI server implementation with minimal configuration
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` - Dependency management file (if needed for FastAPI)

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### 1. Analyze Current Python Environment
- Check if there's an existing dependency management system in place
- Determine the appropriate way to add FastAPI dependency
- Review existing `apps/main.py` to understand current Python setup

### 2. Create FastAPI Server Implementation
- Create `apps/server.py` with a minimal FastAPI application
- Include basic health check endpoint (GET /)
- Include a simple API endpoint for demonstration (GET /api/status)
- Add proper imports and basic configuration
- Ensure the server can be run directly with `python apps/server.py`

### 3. Add Dependency Management
- Create appropriate dependency file (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)
- Include FastAPI and uvicorn dependencies
- Add any other essential dependencies for the minimal server

### 4. Add Basic Documentation
- Include docstrings in the server code
- Add inline comments explaining key components
- Ensure code follows Python best practices

### 5. Validate Implementation
- Test that the server can be imported without errors
- Verify the server can start up successfully
- Confirm endpoints are accessible and return expected responses

## Validation Commands
Execute these commands to validate the chore is complete:

- `python -c "import apps.server; print('Server module imports successfully')"` - Test import functionality
- `python apps/server.py` - Start the server (should run without errors)
- `curl http://localhost:8000/` - Test health check endpoint (run in separate terminal)
- `curl http://localhost:8000/api/status` - Test API endpoint (run in separate terminal)

## Notes
- Keep the implementation minimal but functional
- Focus on creating a solid foundation that can be extended later
- Ensure the server integrates well with the existing codebase structure
- Use standard FastAPI patterns and conventions
