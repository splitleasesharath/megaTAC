## User Story

As a user  
I want to generate synthetic data based on existing table patterns  
So that I can expand my test datasets with realistic data

## Test Steps

10. Click the Generate Data button
11. **Verify** the button shows a loading spinner
12. Take a screenshot of the loading state

13. Wait for the generation to complete (up to 30 seconds)
14. **Verify** a success message appears (e.g., "Successfully generated and inserted 10 rows")
15. Take a screenshot of the success message

16. **Verify** the row count for the users table has increased by 10
17. Take a screenshot of the updated table information

    - Enter query: "Show me the last 10 rows from users order by rowid desc"
    - Click Query button
